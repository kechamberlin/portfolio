      <p>
        Hey! My name is Kris and I'm an aspiring web developer from southern
        California. After obtaining a history degree from UC Santa Barbara, I
        decided to challenge myself and attended a full-stack certificate
        program. There, I discovered my love for front-end programming and
        design.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I'm not coding, I enjoy pursuing my passions for video games,
        creative writing, playing bass, and making memories with my fianc√©
        Aleah.
      </p>
      <Stacks />
