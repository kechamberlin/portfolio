A website for my fiance's father's law firm based in Modesto, California.

## Background

AG Law started as my final project for my coding boot camp. My fiance's father, Anthony, had recently passed the BAR exam and became a practicing attorney. The website he was using was a generic GoDaddy template, and I wanted to make a more appealing product.

My final project was merely a single home page made via create-react-app with limited functionality. I couldn't even get react-scroll to work, nor did the contact form connect to a database. The only "advanced" feature it had was storing associate lawyers in MongoDB, but I confess one of the class TAs helped with setting that up and fetching the data. Subsequently, it has been my go-to project every time I learn a new technology.

## Take Aways

- Furthered developed Next.js skills
- How to store data in and fetch from React Markdown files
- Submitting form data to a database
- Simple filtering with booleans

## Tech Stack

- Next.js
- Node.js
- MongoDB
- React Markdown

## Future

Ever since the coding boot camp, I've been determined to further my development skills and create for Anthony a real, working website he can use. Although this project is strictly for portfolio purposes, I have learned a lot in a year and a half since earning my certificate and my next stage is to make a real world application.

Currently, I am collaborating with Anthony exactly what he wants in his website and planning technologies to be used, folder structure, color themes, and functionality. As of now, I plan to use Next.js, Apollo, Node.js, Keystone Headless CMS, and GraphQL.
