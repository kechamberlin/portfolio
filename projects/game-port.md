A video game library where users can search over half a million games.

## Features

- Instantly search for your favorite games or discover new ones
- View the summary, Metacritic score, and other basic information for the queried game
- Find other games in the series
- Uses session storage to minimize requests sent to the API

## Features To Be Added

While I designed this project to be very small in scale initially, these are features I would like to add at a later point:

- A login portal
- Add a game to a custom wishlist
- Rating system
- Drop a comment for a specific game
- Convert load more button to infinite scroll
- Increase browsing navigation endpoints (i.e., games by a certain developer, genres, etc.)

## Take Aways

I had 3 main focuses for this project:

- Increase design and CSS skills
- Implement search functionality
- Showcase ability to manipulate data from a 3rd party API

## Tech Stack

- React
- React Router
- Styled Components
- JavaScript
- RAWG Video Game Database API
